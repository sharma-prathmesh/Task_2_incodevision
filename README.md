Internship Task 02 Completed: Exploratory Data

Analysis (EDA) in Python

In this task, I explored a cleaned dataset using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to understand the data before building any model.

What I did:
Generated statistical summaries
Visualized data using histograms and bar charts
Analyzed relationships using correlation plots
Identified patterns in Age, Gender, and Salary
This task helped me learn how data scientists first understand and explore data to extract meaningful insights before applying machine learning algorithms. Grateful for the learning experience and continuous improvement during my internship journey
